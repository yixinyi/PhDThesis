\chapter{$\mathcal{N} = 4$ SYM}

Consider the action of a $d$-dimensional Yang-Mills (YM) theory 
with a massless spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ field $\Psi$ in the adjoint representation of the gauge group $U(N)$:
% (we will consider $SU(N)$)
\begin{equation}
 S = - \dfrac{1}{g_{YM}^2} \int d^d x \, \text{tr}
     \left(
         \dfrac{1}{2}F_{M N}F^{M N}
       - \bar{\Psi} \Gamma^M D_M \Psi 
     \right),    
\end{equation}
where $F_{M N} =\sum_{a=1}^{N^2} F_{M N}^a T^a_{ij}$, so that the trace is over the matrix indices $i, j=1, \ldots, N$. 
$T^a$ are the generators of the gauge group.
More explicitly, the field-strength and the covariant derivative are
\begin{eqnarray}
 F_{MN} &=& \partial_M A_N - \partial_N A_M + [A_M, A_N],\\
 D_M &=& \partial_M  + [A_M, \cdot].
\end{eqnarray}

% \begin{eqnarray}
%  F_{MN}^a &=& \partial_M A_N^a - \partial_N A_M^a + f_{abc} A_M^b A_N^c,\\
%  D_M \Psi^a &=& \partial_M \Psi^a + f_{abc} A_M^b \Psi^c,
% \end{eqnarray}
% where the structure constants $f_{abc}$ are defined by the commutation relation $[T^a, T^b]=f_{abc} T^c$.


In Minkowski spacetime $\mathbb{R}^{9,1}$, 
this action turns out to be invariant under the supersymmetry transformation:
\begin{eqnarray}
 \delta_\epsilon A_M  & = & \epsilon \Gamma_M \Psi,\\
 \delta_\epsilon \Psi & = & \dfrac{1}{2} F_{M N} \Gamma^{M N} \epsilon,
\end{eqnarray}
where $\epsilon$ is a constant Majorana-Weyl spinor that parametrizes the transformation.
% The bosonic and the fermionic degrees of freedom indeed match,
% \begin{itemize}
%  \item Bosonic: $D-2 = 8$
%  \item Fermionic: $2^{D/2}/2/2 = 8$
% \end{itemize}
% which is a necessary condition for supersymmetry. 

 
Lower dimensional supersymmetric theories can actually be obtained by 
dimensional reduction from the above theory \cite{Brink:1976bc}. 
Let us review how we can derive the action for the maximally supersymmetric
$\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM on $\mathbb{R}^{4}$.

\section{Action on $\mathbb{R}^{4}$}
The dimensional reduction consists of restricting the dependence of the fields only to 4 dimensions: $(x_1, \ldots, x_4)$.
The original Lorentz symmetry group $Spin(9,1)$ is then broken to $Spin(4) \times Spin(5,1)^R$,
that is the Lorentz group in 4d and an internal symmetry group called R-symmetry (hence the superindex $R$).
These groups are isomorphic to:
\begin{eqnarray}
Spin(4)      &=& SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \\
Spin(5, 1)^R &=& Spin(4)^R \times SO(1,1)^R \\
	     &=& SU(2)^R_L \times SU(2)^R_R \times SO(1,1)^R.
\end{eqnarray}
% where the subindexes $L, R$ refers to left and right. 

The gauge field $A_M$ is reduced to the 4d gauge field and scalars:
\begin{eqnarray}
 Spin(4):     & \,& A_\mu, \quad \mu = 1, 2, 3, 4 \\
%  Spin(5,1)^R: & \,& \Phi_I, \quad I = 0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
 Spin(4)^R: & \,& \Phi_I, \quad I = 5, 6, 7, 8 \\
 SO(1,1)^R: & \,& \Phi_I, \quad I = 0, 9 
\end{eqnarray}
where we wrote down the group they transform under.

The fermionic field, which is a Majorana-Weyl spinor, 
can be decomposed to 4 Majorana spinors (each having 2 degrees of freedom):
\begin{equation}
 \Psi=\begin{bmatrix}
       \psi_L\\
       \chi_R\\
       \psi_R\\
       \chi_L
      \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
where the spinors with the subindex $L$ (or $R$) transform in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ representation of
$SU(2)_L$ (or $SU(2)_R$).
Also, spinors with the name $\psi$ and $\chi$ transform in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ representation of
$SU(2)_L^R$ and $SU(2)_R^R$ from the R-symmetry subgroup, respectively.




The $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM action explicitly written in terms of the 4d bosonic fields is:
\begin{equation}\label{SR4}
  \begin{split}
    S_{\mathbb{R}^4} = - \dfrac{1}{g_{YM}^2} \int d^4 x \, \text{tr}
    (
         \dfrac{1}{2}F_{\mu \nu}F^{\mu \nu}
       + D_\mu \Phi_I D^\mu \Phi^I
       + \dfrac{1}{2} [\Phi_I, \Phi_J]\, [\Phi^I, \Phi^J]       
    \\
       \qquad
       - \bar{\Psi} \Gamma^\mu D_\mu \Psi 
       - \bar{\Psi} \Gamma^I [ \Phi_I, \Psi ]
    ),
   \end{split}
\end{equation}
where we decomposed the 10d gamma matrices as $\Gamma^M=\Gamma^\mu \otimes \Gamma^I$.


The action has no mass scale, and it is in fact conformal invariant even at quantum level \cite{MANDELSTAM1983149, BRINK1983323}.
The conformal group extends the Poincar\'e group (translation, rotations and boosts) 
to include scaling (dilatation),
and special conformal transformation, which is a composition of inversion, translation and inversion.
The conformal symmetry, the four copies of supersymmetry and the internal R-symmetry
are part of the larger $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal group $PSU(2,2|4)$.
Its Lie algebra is generated by the generators of the conformal algebra, 
16 supercharges (that commute with momentum generators),
and 16 superconformal charges (that commute with special conformal generators). 
Details of the algebra can be found for example in \cite{Minahan:2010js}.


\section{Action on $S^4$}
In order to apply supersymmetric localization to $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, 
we shall put this theory on a hypersphere $S^4$.
% , which can be done using conformal invariance.
Conformal invariance implies an additional conformal coupling of the scalars to the scalar curvature $\mathcal{R}$, 
namely,
\begin{equation}\label{conformalCoupling}
 \dfrac{\mathcal{R}}{6} \Phi^I \Phi_I, \quad I=0,5,6,7,8,9
\end{equation}
where for $S^d$ with radius $R$, the scalar curvature is $\mathcal{R} = d(d-1)/R^2 $.
Then, there will be also a metric factor $\sqrt{g}$ coming from the curved background.
The action on $S^4$ is hence
\begin{equation}\label{SS4}
  \begin{split}
    S_{S^4} = - \dfrac{1}{g_{YM}^2} \int d^4 x \, \sqrt{g} \text{tr}
    \left(
        \dfrac{1}{2}F_{\mu \nu}F^{\mu \nu}
       + D_\mu \Phi_I D^\mu \Phi^I
       + \dfrac{1}{2} [\Phi_I, \Phi_J]\, [\Phi^I, \Phi^J]       
    \right. \\
    \left. 
       \qquad
       - \bar{\Psi} \Gamma^\mu D_\mu \Psi 
       - \bar{\Psi} \Gamma^I [ \Phi_I, \Psi ]
       + \dfrac{2}{R^2} \Phi^I \Phi_I
    \right).
   \end{split}
\end{equation}
Localization also requires the existence of an off-shell supersymmetry.
To fulfill this condition, additional auxiliary field terms are added to the above action, see \cite{Pestun:2007rz, Festuccia:2011ws}.
Then, on the localization locus, the action will effectively be $3/2$ times the conformal coupling \eqref{conformalCoupling}, 
see also \cite{Russo:2013qaa}.
Naturally, at the decompactification limit $R \rightarrow \infty$, we recover the flat space version.
% We shall see this limit is important for many of our results.







\chapter{$\mathcal{N} = 2^*$ SYM}

The fields of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM form a $\mathcal{N}=4$ vector (or gauge) multiplet, 
but the latter can be decomposed into two $\mathcal{N}=2$ massless supermultiplets, namely
\begin{eqnarray}
 \text{Vector multiplet:} & & \{A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, \Phi_0, \Phi_9, \psi_L, \psi_R\},  \\
 \text{Matter hypermultiplet:} & &\{\Phi_5, \Phi_6, \Phi_7, \Phi_8, \chi_L, \chi_R\}.
\end{eqnarray}	

$\mathcal{N}=2^*$ SYM is the unique massive deformation of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM that breaks half of its supersymmetries.
This is achieved by giving mass to the matter hypermultiplet, 
either via the $\mathcal{N}=1$ superpotential \cite{Buchel:2000cn, Bobev:2013cja}, 
or using Scherk-Schwarz reduction of $\mathcal{N}=1$ SYM \cite{Pestun:2007rz, Scherk:1979zr}.
The latter prescribes the following replacement rules in the action \eqref{SR4}:
\begin{eqnarray}
D_0 \Phi_i &\rightarrow & D_0 \Phi_i + M_{ij} \Phi_j, \quad i,j =5,\ldots 8 \\
D_0 \chi &\rightarrow & D_0 \chi + \dfrac{1}{4}\Gamma_{ij} M_{ij} \chi,
\end{eqnarray}
where $M_{ij}$, a $4 \times 4$ matrix, is a generator of $SU(2)^R_R$,
and is normalized as $M_{ij} M^{ij} = 4 M^2$, where $M$ is the mass scale. All the repeated indices are summed over.
These replacements will give the standard mass term to the bosons and the fermions, 
and a cubic coupling term for the scalars. 
In its infinite-mass limit, the matter hypermultiplet can be integrated out, 
and the resulting theory is the pure $\mathcal{N}=2$ SYM.


% The full mass term to be added to the massless theory is:
% \begin{equation}
%  S_\text{mass} = \dfrac{1}{2 g_{YM}^2} \int d^4 x \, \sqrt{g} 
%  \text{tr} \left( m^2 \Phi_i \Phi^i + m (\chi_1 \chi_1 + \chi_2 \chi_2 + h.c.) 
%            -\dfrac{1}{4 r} R_{ki} M_{kj} \Phi^i \Phi^j
%            \right)
% \end{equation}
In order to apply the localization method to the partition function of $\mathcal{N}=2^*$ SYM,
we need to put it on $S^4$.
Since the theory is no longer conformal due to the hypermultiplet mass scale,
an additional curvature correction term to the mass is required in order to preserve supersymmetry, 
besides the conformal coupling discussed in \eqref{SS4}.
% Moreover, localization requires off-shell supersymmetry, and that is fixed by an auxiliary field term to the action.
The full action can be found in \cite{Pestun:2007rz}, with the details of the localization procedure therein.
We are interested in the final localized result, that we will discuss next.

% In the limit of infinitely heavy hypermultiplet, these fields possess no dynamic degrees of freedom,
% hence we can integrate them out and then the resulting theory is the pure $\mathcal{N}=2$ SYM.

% \section{Action }

% Let us first review how to obtain the actions of our theories. 
% We will start with the action of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM on $\mathbb{R}^{3,1}$. 
% It is convenient to use the language of $\mathcal{N}=1$ SYM in $\mathbb{R}^{9,1}$, 
% from which all supersymmetric actions for lower dimensional Yang-Mills theory can be obtained from (cite someone).
% 
% The action is 
% \begin{equation}
%  S = \int d^4 x\, \sqrt{g} \mathcal{L}.
% \end{equation}
% 
% The Lagrangian density for $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM on $S^4$:
% \begin{equation}
%  \mathcal{L}_{$\mathcal{N}=4$} = -\dfrac{1}{g_{YM}^2} 
%     \text{tr}\left(
%       \frac{1}{2}F_{MN}F^{MN} - \Psi \Gamma^M D_M \Psi  + \dfrac{2}{r^2} \Phi_A \Phi^A
%     \right).  
% \end{equation}
% For $\mathcal{N}=2^*$ SYM, we add mass to the hypermultiplet (in the covariant derivatives),
% \begin{equation}
%  \mathcal{L}_{$\mathcal{N}=2$^*} = 
% 		     -\dfrac{1}{g_{YM}^2} 
% 			   \text{tr} \left(
% 			      \frac{1}{2}F_{MN}F^{MN} - \Psi \Gamma^M D_M \Psi  + \dfrac{2}{r^2} \Phi_A \Phi^A
% 			      -\dfrac{1}{4 r} R_{ki} M_{kj} \Phi^i \Phi^j - K_i K^i
% 			    \right). 
% \end{equation}
% where the last term is added in order to have an off-shell susy so that the localization can be applied.
