\chapter{Acknowledgement}


First of all, I would like to thank Kostya for being my supervisor, teacher and a model physicist. 
Much of the success of this thesis is due to him, as well as to the hard-work and perseverance of my other collaborators: Amit, Daniel and Jamie. I very much appreciate having you to discuss our projects and work together.

I also thank Kostya and Amit for proofreading parts of my manuscript. Thanks goes to Erik for the Swedish translation of the summary. 

I thank Nordita for a nice working environment, and fellow students Erik, Daniel and Janina, who literally added light, music and chocolate to the office.

I would like to thank the GATIS network for funding my first three years of research and training my soft skills.

Last but not least, let me finally acknowledge my dearest Stephane, for his more-than-a-thousand times speedup of the numerical code used in my first paper, and his careful proofreading of many of my texts, including parts of this thesis.
